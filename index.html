            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>I was previously a recording artist and songwriter. I enjoyed that time in my life, I met a lot of interesting people. 
              When I decided it was time to carve out a new path for myself, I came upon web development. This might seem like a completely 
              different direction to people who donâ€™t know me, but technology has always peaked my interest.  
              I am fascinated with how the internet works and look forward to learning more.</p>

            <h3>Interest and Hobbies</h3>
            <p>When I am not learning how to code, I enjoy going to the gym, listening to music, and keeping up with what is going on 
              in space. </p>
